googlescript.sh

A automated script that uses various GooleDork/GoogleHack queries to enumerate a company and email address domain.

usage ./googlescript.sh <www.<domain name>.<com, net etc> @<email domain>

Queries run every 25 seconds to stop Goolge having a hissy fit about traffic volume. But it's still quicker manual enumeration.
