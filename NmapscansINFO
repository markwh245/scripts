A basic automated Nmap scan script.

Will do the -A, -O, -sV -sS, -sU, "The big scan of TCP:0-65535" and Network File Shares Search.

It will create new Dir on the Desktop based on the target host IP/Domain name store each scan in there individually.

Scans run in parallel, there is no throttling, so it's not any good for outside of HackTheBox etc.

Usage
./Nmapscans.sh <target>
